# Book-Store
Book Store üìö


## Problem Statement

> In Saudi Arabia, there are a few websites that sell books such as Jarir bookstore. However,  
Jarir has many other departments, and browsing their website can cause some confusion to readers "book buyers".


## Project Proposal
>The book site helps to obtain books in all fields and languages, 
and because most of the sites are not specialized in selling books only, 
but with different classifications, our site gives sufficient focus on selling and providing books.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Solutions:
Our site solution has defined pages by using (HTML,CSS,PHP,SQL) language and we define the page such as 
: Homepage, Register/Login, FAQs ,Cart, Order Tracking, About us , Our Services``Product Page‚Äù, Contact us  and Payment Page. 
we use agile methods.
